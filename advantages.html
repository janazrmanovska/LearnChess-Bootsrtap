            <h5 class="text-center text-danger" style="font-size: 3rem">Why you should play chess?</h5>
        </div>
        <div class="col text-center mt-5">
            <h5 class="text-center">Chess develops the ability to see from someone else’s perspective </h5>
            <p>Skilled chess players learn to anticipate an opponent’s next moves.
                To predict what another person will do next, a player must develop the ability to adopt another person’s perspective and infer what action they are likely to take.
                Behavioral scientists call this this ability to see from another viewpoint the “theory of mind.
                ” It’s an ability that is essential to exercising empathy and building healthy social relationships.
                A 2019 studyTrusted Source found that chess develops this perspective-taking ability in children who practice the game.</p>

            <h5 class="text-center">Chess improves memory</h5>
            <p>It might not be surprising to learn that expert chess players have strong memory skills.
                After all, the game involves memorizing numerous combinations of moves and their potential outcomes.
                It’s also interesting to note that experienced chess players show higher performance related to a particular kind of recollection: auditory memory.
                This is the ability to remember what you’ve learned through hearing.
                In one experiment, researchersTrusted Source compared the recall ability of expert chess players to that of people with no chess-playing experience.
                They found that the chess players were significantly better at recalling lists of words they’d heard than people who had never played chess.
                Skilled chess players also have a better than average ability to remember and quickly recognize visual patterns, which researchersTrusted Source think comes from memorizing complex chess positions.</p>

            <h5 class="text-center">Chess enables you to enter a flow state</h5>
            <p>Flow is a deeply rewarding sense of total involvement, in which you’re operating at a peak performance level in a challenging task.
                Athletes, artists, and performers often describe entering a kind of time warp,
                where they are so wholly focused on the task at hand that their awareness of anything beyond the performance seems to disappear.
                ResearchersTrusted Source who study brain activity noted that theta waves are heightened in electroencephalograms (EEGs) taken when people are in a state of flow.
                Studies have shown the same high levels of theta waves in brain scans of experienced chess players during increasingly difficult chess matches.</p>

            <h5 class="text-center">Chess elevates your creativity</h5>
            <p>Researchers at a school in India tested the creative thinking skills of two groups of students.
                One group was trained in chess playing, and the other was not.
                The tests asked students to come up with alternate uses for common items and to interpret patterns and meaning in abstract forms.
                Students who played chess scored higher on tests. Researchers concluded that chess increased the students’ ability to exercise divergent and creative thinking.</p>
